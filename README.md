# Description
This is Python 3 script that will fix the hyperlinks in Excel file (xlsx).
After unexpected shut down of Excel, if you use AutoSaved files to recover the previously saved file you will often find that all the previously working hyperlinks don't work. The AutoSave is changing the hyperlinks to reference the "../../../AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Excel" folder. With this script you can easily fix them to their original state.
